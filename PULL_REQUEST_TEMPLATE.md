Wanna contribute on adding games with pictures and backgrounds? Now you can! Just do a pull request editing the [Games List.json](https://github.com/YumeKawaiii/Xbox-RPC-Discord/blob/main/Games%20List.json) file!
- "titlename" should have the original name of the game that shows on Xbox, remove any Copyright or Trademark symbols
- Images on "titleicon" should be 1024x1024, and "titlebackground" can be any size but choose one that fits on the app correctly
- "titleimage" is a Discord parameter, give it any name or the game name, i will edit it after the pull request
- "type" (number) is the kind of game or app, Use the following numbers depending of the type of app or game:
  - (1) For games, it will show "Playing (game)"
  - (2) For video apps, it will show "Watching (app)"
  - (3) For another kind of apps, it will show "Using (app)"

Remember, edit the complete code and add your game array, make sure to add  
any necessary commas and brackets  

I will check the code later, edit it with my titleimage and merge it if everything is ok.

*You can delete this text before doing the pull request if you want*
